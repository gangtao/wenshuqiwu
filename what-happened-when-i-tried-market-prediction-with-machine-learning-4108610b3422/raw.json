The vast piles of time series data, coupled with the possibility of retiring young has the irresistible pull of finding an old treasure map in your grandfather’s attic. How can you NOT think about it? Can you use machine learning to predict the market?",

They show you how to pull down the history of a stock, perhaps calculate a few indicators, and feed it to a regression algorithm and try to predict the next day’s value. Alternatively, they use a classifier to predict whether the stock will rise or fall, without predicting a value.",

A Python script took care of converting them into a consistent format, filling in missing values, and dropping time series that didn’t go back to at least the early 2000’s. All told, when the dust cleared, I had over a thousand columns in a nice Pandas table with 18 years of data.",

That made the number of columns explode. The dataset was ready to input to the training model with over 32000 columns.",

The second was a regression model, which predicted the next day’s close price.",
