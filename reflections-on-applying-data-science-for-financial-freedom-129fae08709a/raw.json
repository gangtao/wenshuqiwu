Sorry to my normal peeps that wanted some coding samples. Today’s article is going to feel like a relaxing talk at a bar’s fireplace. So, let’s turn up the smooth jazz and get started.",

There are tons of ways to make money with data science, but the financial markets are how I did it for myself. Also when I say system, I am referring to an investment strategy or portfolio of strategies, which can be turned into an automated model.",

  "text": "Most of you that are comfortable in the finance space know of the Efficient Market Hypothesis. But as a refresher, the Efficient Market Hypothesis states that the market price of an asset is perfectly priced, and all market participants know all information. The value of studying theories like Efficient Market Hypothesis is to learn why they were wrong. In doing so, you will discover paths that will lead you to profitable systems. Efficient Market Hypothesis was a pretty dominant theory in the past before behavioral finance started to take over. I guess, looking back, it made sense. I mean trading the markets is hard, so it must have been efficient.",

It was an open collaboration in a semi public forum. The system was working great for a few months like 10%/month great. Then the forum got a little more popular, and the system died. It could have been a result of too many people capitalizing on the inefficiency or the underlying reason for that event just got removed for another reason. That’s the thing about technical analysis, you pretty much just trust whatever the chart is doing without any underlying economic reason.",
  "translation": "请记住，其中大多数系统不会永远持续下去。 例如，在2015年，我正在为EURUSD（一种外币资产）开发技术分析系统。 这是在半公开论坛上的开放式合作。 该系统运行了好几个月，就像每月10％一样。 然后论坛变得更受欢迎了，系统死了。 可能是由于太多人利用效率低下的原因或该事件的根本原因刚刚由于其他原因而被删除。 技术分析就是这样，您几乎可以信任图表所做的任何操作，而没有任何潜在的经济原因。"

Alas, the quest for looking for more strategies never ends as markets always change. To stay ahead, you must change with it.",
