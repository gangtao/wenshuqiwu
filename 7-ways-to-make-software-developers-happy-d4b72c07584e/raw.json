Playing off the concept of mastery, software engineers love new technologies and keeping abreast of modern ideas. New tools, frameworks and paradigms are constantly established, but some managers refrain from letting them try new things and fear any change of the existing status quo. This can lead to a stagnant culture where developers lose their spark of curiosity. As a result, the codebases become really difficult to maintain, ugly to read and expensive to support. Eventually, your top talent will leave and you will have trouble finding anyone who is willing to work on obsolete brownfield projects.",

Another easy way to excite the developers is to encourage them to build DevOps tools using languages, databases or frameworks that differ from your normal stack.",

Being on L3 Support (that dreadful S-word!) is a good candidate for rotation.",
