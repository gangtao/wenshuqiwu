Materials are different than nerves, and so on. If we would like to make something that runs rapidly over the ground, then we could watch a cheetah running, and we could try to make a machine that runs like a cheetah. But, it's easier to make a machine with wheels. With fast wheels or something that flies just above the ground in the air. When we make a bird, the airplanes don't fly like a bird, they fly but they don't fly like a bird, okay? They don't flap their wings exactly, they have in front, another gadget that goes around, or the more modern airplane has a tube that you heat the air and squirt it out the back, a jet propulsion, a jet engine, has internal rotating fans and so on, and uses gasoline. It's different, right?So, there's no question that the later machines are not going to think like people think, in that sense.With regard to intelligence, I think it's exactly the same way, for example they're not going to do arithmetic the same way as we do arithmetic, but they'll do it better.",
  "translation": "关于我们是否可以像人一样思考的问题，我的意见基于以下思想：我们试图使这些事物在我们拥有的材料下尽可能有效地发挥作用。材料不同于神经，依此类推。如果我们想制造出可以在地面上快速运行的东西，那么我们可以观察到猎豹的奔跑，并且可以尝试制造出像猎豹一样运转的机器。但是，制造带轮子的机器会更容易。使用快速车轮或在空中飞过地面的东西。当我们做鸟时，飞机不像鸟一样飞行，它们虽然飞但不像鸟一样飞行，好吗？他们没有完全拍打机翼，而是在前面，又有一个小配件在飞，或者更现代的飞机上装有一根管子，您可以加热空气并向后喷，喷气推进器，喷气发动机，内部旋转风扇等，并使用汽油。是的，所以毫无疑问，后来的机器在这种意义上不会像人们想象的那样思考。关于智能，我认为这是完全一样的，例如他们不会做算术就像我们做算术一样，但是他们会做得更好。"

In statistics and machine learning, the bias–variance tradeoff is the property of a set of predictive models whereby models with a lower bias in parameter estimation have a higher variance of the parameter estimates across samples, and vice versa. The bias-variance dilemma describes the optimization problem whereby one tries to simultaneously minimize bias errors from erroneous assumptions in a learning algorithm and the variance from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set.",
