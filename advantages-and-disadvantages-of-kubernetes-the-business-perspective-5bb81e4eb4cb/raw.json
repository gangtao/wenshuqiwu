The same goes if your application itself grows and becomes more complex. Here, microservice architectures often come into play and for these, Kubernetes is clearly the technology of choice as of today. And finally, if you want to switch your cloud vendor for some reason, e.g. moving from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Microsoft Azure, you can easily find a very similar Kubernetes service from a different provider and Kubernetes itself makes such a switch relatively seamless preventing you from vendor lock-in.",

Since the platform itself has some general computing needs, it is usually more expensive for very small applications. However, the larger your computing resource needs, the less important are these basic infrastructure needs for the overall cost calculation. In such cases, other factors become more important. For example, Kubernetes is able to auto-scale depending on the needs of your application and the incoming traffic and load processed by your applications. That means, that Kubernetes can scale up your applications and its required resources during peak times but also scale down your infrastructure during less busy times of the year, week or even hours of the day. That means you pay less if there is not much going on. Overall, this leads to high utilization and prevents you from paying for resources that you do not need.",
